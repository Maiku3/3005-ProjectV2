## Installation and Setup

To get the Health and Fitness Club Management System running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you do not have them, install them from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installing

Clone the repository, install both backend & fronted dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/Maiku3/3005-ProjectV2.git
cd health-fitness-club-app
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
npm install
```

### Build the Frontend
